👋 I'm Zack, a Senior Software Engineer at [Slack](https://slack.com/) and previously at [Datto](https://www.datto.com/). In industry I have predominantly worked on internal tooling and test automation/frameworks. On my off-time I enjoy [CTFs](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) ([eJPT cert](https://verified.elearnsecurity.com/certificates/149d6a59-c834-4377-84b0-d13b50852a2f)), tinkering with APIs, automating ecommerce and lifting 🏋️

Repos here are to serve more as a "portfolio" of previous work; I like to think of it as my diary in a way.

I have a shoddy website 😂
